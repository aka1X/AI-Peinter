# Real-Time Smart Drawing

This project is an interactive application that allows users to draw in real-time using gesture and object detection through a camera.

The user can interact with the application through hand movements or detected objects to draw shapes, lines, or trigger drawing actions.

 Technologies Used :

    -CNN for gesture recognition

    -YOLO for object detection

    -OpenCV and MediaPipe for image processing

    -p5.js for the drawing interface
